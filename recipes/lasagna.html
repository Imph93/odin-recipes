    <h3>Instructions</h3>

    <p>

        <ol>
            <li>Peel and finely chop the onions, garlic, carrots and celery – don’t worry about the technique, just chop away until fine. Halve the capsicums, remove the stalks and seeds and roughly chop.</li>
            <li>Heat 2 tablespoons~ of oil in a large casserole pan on a medium-high heat, add the chopped veg, cumin, cinnamon and a good pinch of sea salt and black pepper, Also add the chilli powder during this stage if you are using it, then cook for 7 minutes, or until softened, stirring regularly.</li>
            <li>Drain and add the chickpeas and kidney beans, tip in the tomatoes, breaking them up with the back of a spoon, then pour in 1 tin's worth of water. Add the minced beef, breaking any larger chunks.</li>
            <li>Pick the coriander leaves and put aside, then finely chop and add the stalks to the pan, with the balsamic vinegar. Season with a good pinch of sea salt and black pepper.</li>
            <li>Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat to low and simmer with a lid slightly ajar for 1 hour, or until slightly thickened and reduced, stirring occasionally.</li>
            <li>Serve up with fluffy rice or couscous, a hunk of crusty bread, or over a jacket potato, with some yoghurt, guacamole, and wedges of lime on the side for squeezing over. Sprinkle over the reserved coriander, and some fresh chilli, if you like, then tuck in.</li>
        </ol>
